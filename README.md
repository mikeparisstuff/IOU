IOU
===

A Simple IOU application for Android

This is the first real peice of software that I ever wrote completely by myself and completely for fun.
It is far from perfect, it is simple, and it taught me more lessons of how not to do things as well as
how to do things better than any CS course I have ever taken. I keep this as a reminder that we all have
to start somewhere.  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paris.IOU#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLnBhcmlzLklPVSJd">Download on Google Play</a>
